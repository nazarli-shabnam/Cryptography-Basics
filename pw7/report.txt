The Rail Fence Cipher is a classical transposition cipher that rearranges plaintext characters in a
zig-zag pattern across multiple "rails" (rows) before reading them row-wise to form the ciphertext. 
This project implements the Rail Fence Cipher in  Java, supporting encryption and decryption with a variable depth 
(minimum depth of 3 as requested).
        ~Encryption Process~
1.Initialize Rails 

2.Zig-Zag Placement 
    2.1 . Start at the first rail and place the first character of the plaintext in the first position of th
    at rail.
    2.2 . Move to the next rail and place the next character in the next position
    2.3 . Continue this process until all characters have been placed in the zig-zag

3.Read the ciphertext row-wise from the zig-zag pattern


        ~Decryption Process~
1.Reconstruct Rail Pattern
2.Place ciphertext characters sequentially in the marked positions.
3.Traverse the rails in the same zig-zag pattern to reconstruct the original plaintext.
